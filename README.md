# Workplace-Wearables
Wearable devices and technologies are being deployed at the workplace to promote occupational safety, health, and productivity. 
Smart hardware and software are being developed to protect and promote total worker health to identify, eliminate, substitute, and control different types of occupational hazards. 
Wearable devices help provide real-time monitoring of workers and the environment, while the connected worker solutions provide contextual information and decision-making support. 
Connected worker platforms and predictive analytics provide contextual and situational information about occupational safety risks and hazards, resource allocation and scheduling, equipment failure and possible risk mitigation strategies, and predictive maintenance. 
Altogether, this review highlights the benefits and technical challenges of real-time visibility about frontline workers, work environment, distributed assets, workforce efficiency, and safety compliance.
